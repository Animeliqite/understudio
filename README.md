<h3 align="center">Important Rules</h3>
<p>1. This is a brand new branch, aiming to recreate UnderStudio into something robust to all the developers.</p>
<p>2. UnderStudio might use external assets later on. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/colinator27" target="_blank">Colinator27</a> for helping with all the problems.</p>
<p>3. You'll have to credit the people behind this project upon using it on your project. Legal action will be taken otherwise.</p>
<p>4. UnderStudio uses the latest beta version of Game Maker Studio 2. Only people with beta releases access will be able to use it.</p>
<p>5. The engine will stay public to everyone as long as this gets credited by all the users.</p>
