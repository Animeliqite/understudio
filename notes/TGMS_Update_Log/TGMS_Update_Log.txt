 Known Issues
===============

	*	Tweens with struct targets are not being automatically destroyed.
	*	For now, please call TweenDestroy() manually for any tweens with struct targets.
	*	This seems due to a bug with GameMaker's garbage collector.


========================
= Changes Since Beta 4 =
========================

[5.2]
-Updated TweenSet() support
	* TweenSet(t, "start/destination", 123) better supports tweens created with TweenCreate()
	* TweenSet/Get(tween, "property") works again!
	* Added "raw_start" and "raw_destination" support for TweenGet()/TweenSet()
	
-Extended tween selection to support custom lists and arrays holding tween ids
	* e.g.
		tList = ds_list_create();
		ds_list_add(tList, tween1, tween2, tween3);
		TweenPause({list: tList});
		
		tArray = [tween1, tween2, tween3];
		TweenResume({list: tArray});
		
		TweenStop({list: [tween1, tween2, tween3]});


[5.1]
-Fixed issue with struct targets when using TweenCreate()/TweenPlay() -- also fixes using self/other keywords
-TweenStep() is functional again (yay!)
-Added TweenSetDefault() / TweenGetDefault()
-Added check to prevent error when group scale is 0
-Updated TweenSet()TweenGet() to support [continue count] labels: "continue_count" "count" "cc"
-TweenDefine() is functional again but experimental and possibly quite buggy -- Maybe don't use it except for backwards compatiblity with existing projects
-Cleaned up TGMS_ExecuteEvent
	* Callbacks can now take an "unlimited" number or arguments
	* Note: built-in GM functions no longer work with callbacks -- please convert to using user functions or methods


[5.0]
-Animation curves ids can now be directly used as ease arguments
	* Custom ease functions must be converted to methods, as function ids are no longer valid
	* Removed EaseCurve()
	* Removed EaseChannel()
	
-An empty string can now be used as ease/curve parameter to denote default (linear)
	* e.g. TweenFire(id, "", "once", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10) // linear ease
	
-Updated EaseToString() 
	* Fixed upper/lower case handling -- case type is now irrelevant like default ease strings --> "MyEase" and "myEASE" are treated the same
	* Channel argument for animation curves is now optional
	
-Updated TweenSet()
	* "rest" now supported
	* "target" now supports structs
	* "ease" now supports animation curve ids
	
-Ease() now supports Animation Curve IDs and Channels
-Added string cache for TGMS_StringLower -- improves performance when initializing tweens
-Fixed potential issue with TweenScript/TweenScriptMore caused by EaseNone
-Fixed crash with TweenSystemClearRoom() -- caused by trying to destroy a list which is now an array
-Fixed issue with ease swapping when using Ease* methods


========================
= Changes Since Beta 3 =
========================

[4.2]
-Fixed struct targets (oops!)

-[self] and [other] can now be used as valid targets
	* TweenFire(self, ...)
	
-Start and Destination strings can now call "global.variable" and "self.variable" explicitly
	* [self] tells to use variable belonging to calling environment when tween fired and not the tween target (though... target and caller are often the same)
	* If no explicit environment is specified, TweenGMS will first check for the existing variable within the target scope, then caller scope, then global scope
	* global.var and self.var currently work but global.var.othervar and global.var.othervar will break -- I hope to expand this in the future


[4.1]
-Fixed issue where starting an easy tween at launch would cause crash
-Fixed TGMS_FetchTween() to properly return undefined/null tween ids
-Adjusted TGMS_FetchTween to prevent crash if o_SharedTweener doesn't exist yet
-Stopped adding "TGMS" layer to rooms


[4.0]
-HTML5 fixes!
-TPFunc*() now supports struct targets
-TPFunc() now properly binds method/function to set target environment
-Removed TPFuncX()
	** TPFunc() now requires a target to help prevent errors caused by assuming wrong target environment
	
-Modified "normalized duration" calculation to be divided by the number of properties
	** You may need to adjust for this change! Please test this change if you've used normalized durations!

-Shared tweener now created immediately at very start of game
	** Do not destroy or deactivate o_SharedTweener

-Ease algorithms must now be methods or animation curve channels -- function ids no longer supported!!
	** EaseFunction = function() { ... } // SUPPORTED
	   function EaseFunction() { ... }   // NOT SUPPORTED -- please convert to method

-Fixed TGMS_FetchTween mishandling structs
	** Caused errors with {group: 0} and {tween: tID} when attempting to select tweens

-Added EaseChannel()
	** Naming convention may change in the futurue
	
-Fixed image_blend... again?
-Fixed TweenSet(tID, "group", 0) not working when trying to assign group
-Improved TweenSet() and TweenGet() -- still in progress
-Added support for property methods inside struct targets
-Improved performance when easing with ease *functions* (not curves)
-Changed tween default to use CurveLinear instead of EaseLinear -- improved performance
-Prevented possible issue where manually creating shared tweener can cause conflict
-Moved default property methods into the global {TGMS} struct environment
-Changed built-in properties to methods -- improves performance
-Added optimised default properties for variables 'z', 'depth', 'friction', 'gravity', 'gravity_direction'
-Fixed ("-time",10) and "=10" not setting time inside Tween*() calls
-Fixed bug with TweenPause() trying to access an non-existing script
-Event map now marks event lists -- may improve tween destruction performance for tweens with event callbacks
-Removed TweenGMS extension file
-Removed TGMS_NULL()


========================
= Changes Since Beta 2 =
========================

	* TweenFire("$60", TPList("myList>", 0), 100); 

-Added EaseToString() for setting custom ease/curve strings
	EaseToString("smooth", SomeEaseFunction);
	EaseToString("butter", SomeCurve, 0);
	TweenFire("$60", "~smooth", ...)
	TweenFire("$60", "~butter", ...)
	
-Functions can now be executed as properties...
	function Spark(value,target,args)
	{
		if (args == undefined)
		{
			effect_create_above(ef_spark, target.x, target.y, 1, c_white*value);
		}
		else
		{
			effect_create_above(ef_spark, target.x, target.y 1, args);
		}
	}
	  
	// Pass function with no arguments
	TweenFire(self, EaseInOutQuad, 2, true, 0, 1, "x>", 100, [Spark], 0, 1);
	
	// Pass function with argument 'c_green'
	TweenFire(self, EaseInOutQuad, 2, true, 0, 1, "x>", 100, [Spark, c_green], 0, 1);
	

========================
= Changes Since Beta 1 =
========================

-Added duration continue swapping
	TweenFire("$", [1,2], "~patrol", "x>", 10);

-Structs can now be used as valid tween targets
	TweenFire(aStruct, EaseLinear, 0, true, 0, 1, "x>", 10);
	** Make sure to delete any structs that need to be cleared right away.
	** Tween callbacks could continue to be fired if struct not cleared from memory.
	** Otherwise, manually destroy tween's as needed.

-Default TweenFire() calls can now use "ease" and "mode" strings
	TweenFire(id, "ioSine", "patrol", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10);

-Default TweenFire() calls can now use advanced array parameters for MODE, DURATION, and DELAY
	TweenFire(id, ["linear","oQuad"], ["patrol",2], true, [0,1,2], [1,2], "x>", 10);
	
-TweenAddCallback()/TweenAddCallbackUser() now support "event" strings
	"finish", "@finish", etc...

-Default EASE functions are now internally converted to animation curves at startup for improved performance.
 However, to make use of them, you must either use "ease" strings or the new Curve* macros
	TweenFire("$60", "~ioQuad", "x>", 10);			// Optimised
	TweenFire("$60", "~", CurveInOutQuad, "x>", 10);	// Optimised
	TweenFire("$60", "~", EaseInOutQuad, "x>", 10);	// Not Optimised -- still calls ease function directly

-Added support for object property prefixes -- "obj_Player.x"
	TweenFire("$60", "obj_Player.x", 0, 10);
	guy = o_Guy;
	TweenFire("$60", "guy.x", 0, 10);

-Fixed To/From support for structs when using TPTarget
	TweenFire("$60", TPTarget(o_Player, "x>"), 10);
	TweenFire("$60", TPTarget(aStruct, "y<"), 10);

-Change TGMS_PropertyMethod to TPFunc() and TPFuncX() -- Can also be directly used in a Tween funcion call
	// Create 'myProp' property to be used in tween call
	TPFunc("myProp", function(value,target){ target.myValue = value }, function(target){ return target.myValue });
	TweenFire("$60", "myProp>", 10);
		
	// Use TPFunc directly inside tween call
	TweenFire("$60", TPFunc("abc", function(v,t){t.abc=v}), 0, 10);
	// "abc" can still be resued in further calls
	TweenFire(">>", "$60", "abc", 10, 100);

-Added ability to pass target id for inline tween callbacks by passing a struct as first array element with target value
	TweenFire(..., "@finish", [{target:other}, Explode]);
	
-Added TWEEN_SELF so tweens can now reference themselves in functions/methods for event callbacks.
	TweenFire("$60", "#patrol", "x>", 100, "@continue", function(){ TweenPause(TWEEN_SELF) });
	
-TweenMore() now works with 0,-1,-2,... indexing
	TweenFire(...);
	TweenMore(0, "ioSine", "patrol", true, 0, 1, "x>", 10);

-Animation curve channels can now be directly passed as an ease type without the need for EaseCurve()
	curve_channel = animcurve_get_channel(animcurve_get(someCurve), 0);
	TweenFire("$60", "~", curve_channel, "x>", 20); 
	
-Added 'Tweens' selection target support
	TweenPause({target: aStruct})
	
-EaseCurve() now takes an optional channel argument

-Added EaseToCurve() for converting existing ease functions into animation curve channels

-Fixed issue where TweenEventClear() failed to actually clear the event... derp.

-TPStruct() has been merged into TPTarget()

-Fixed TweenIsPaused()
